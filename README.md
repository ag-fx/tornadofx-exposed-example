# Example of using TornadoFX together with Exposed
This repo contains an example project of using
[TornadoFX](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx) with
[Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) for database access. The master
branch contains the finished project, while the `part1-3` branches are
companion repos to my series of articles on the subject.
